== ðŸ‘‰  **Why Private Store For Woocommerce plugin?** : ==

> *This is a simple plugin that will help you create private access to preferred customers. A guest customer wonâ€™t be able to see the private products, and they will have to register on your store to be able to view them. You will be able to apply these settings globally across your entire site or only to specific categories, tags or pages.

> * The plugin also offers great control to store owners to handle how they want to control the registration process. When a new user requests for registration, you can approve it manually. Or, for specific users, you can disable the need to login altogether.
